The incompatibility affects 22.9, 22.10 and 22.11 branches (fixed since 22.9.6, 22.10.4 and 22.11.2 correspondingly). Some minor releases of 22.3, 22.7 and 22.8 branches are also affected: 22.3.13...22.3.14 (fixed since 22.3.15), 22.8.6...22.8.9 (fixed since 22.8.10), 22.7.6 and newer (will not be fixed in 22.7, we recommend upgrading from 22.7.* to 22.8.10 or newer). This release note does not concern users that have never used affected versions. Incompatible versions append an extra ",(0,l.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"'\\0'")," to strings when reading states of the aggregate functions mentioned above. For example, if an older version saved state of ",(0,l.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"anyState('foobar')")," to ",(0,l.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"state_column")," then the incompatible version will print ",(0,l.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"'foobar\\0'")," on ",(0,l.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"anyMerge(state_column)"),". Also incompatible versions write states of the aggregate functions without trailing ",(0,l.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"'\\0'"),". Newer versions (that have the fix) can correctly read data written by all versions including incompatible versions, except one corner case. If an incompatible version saved a state with a string that actually ends with null character, then newer version will trim trailing ",(0,l.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"'\\0'")," when reading state of affected aggregate function. For example, if an incompatible version saved state of ",(0,l.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"anyState('abrac\\0dabra\\0')")," to ",(0,l.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"state_column")," then newer versions will print ",(0,l.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"'abrac\\0dabra'")," on ",(0,l.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"anyMerge(state_column)"),".

Iran plans to stop observing DST permanently, after it falls back on 2022-09-21. There are corrections of the historical time zone of Asia/Tehran in the year 1977: Iran adopted standard time in 1935, not 1946. In 1977 it observed DST from 03-21 23:00 to 10-20 24:00; its 1978 transitions were on 03-24 and 08-05, not 03-20 and 10-20; and its spring 1979 transition was on 05-27, not 03-21 (",(0,l.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tzdb/NEWS"},"https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tzdb/NEWS"),").
